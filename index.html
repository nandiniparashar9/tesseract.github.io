      <br>
      5. A Maker may contract with a third party for technical assistance to create the submission provided the submission components are solely the Maker’s work product and the result of the Maker’s ideas and creativity, and the Maker owns all rights to them.
      <br>
      6. Teams can use any libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects.
      <br>
      7. As the software edition of the hackathon is a digital product development competition, majority of the team members MUST be well versed with programming skills. For the hardware edition, we encourage multi-disciplinary teams.
      <br>
      8. Teams will be shortlisted for the nomination from college based on the project submission which will take place from 26 September 2022 in online mode. 
      <br>
      9. Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, breaking the Code of Conduct, or other unsporting behavior.
      <br>
      10. The final round of the hackathon will be conducted in offline mode in the IGDTUW premises only.
    </p>
    <h1>Project submission (Round 1)</h1>
    <p> 
      1. The release of problem statements followed by the project submission will begin shortly after the forms for registration in the hackathon are released.
      <br>
      2. The Maker must make the Application available free of charge and without any restriction, for testing, evaluation and use by the judges during the Hackathon and until the Judging Period ends. Makers must make their Application available for testing by:
       Including a link to the open source Application code on GitHub,including a readme, the appropriate open source license file, and all deployment files and testing instructions needed for testing your Application.
      <br>
      3. Applications may integrate third-party SDKs, APIs and services, provided the Maker is authorized to use them
    </p>
    <h1>Presentation(Round 2)</h1> 
    <p>
      1. Each Team will get 15 minutes to present the project to the judges. 
      <br>
      2. All teams have to bring their Laptops(fully charged) along with other material if required for the presentation. No excuses will be entertained.
      <br>
      3. The presentation must consist of the working code of the problem statement chosen.
      <br>
      4. If plagiarism is found. The team will be disqualified from the competition 
    </p> 
    <h1>Judgment Criteria</h1>
    <p>
    Teams will be judged on these four criteria. Judges will weigh the criteria equally. During judging, participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their project.
    <br>
    </p>
    <p>
     a. Technology: How technically impressive was the hack? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult? Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components? 
    <br>
     b. Design: Did the team put thought into the user experience? How well designed is the interface? For a website, this might be about how beautiful the CSS or graphics are. For a hardware project, it might be more about how good the human-computer interaction is. 
     <br>
     c. Completion: Does the code actually work? Did the team achieve everything they wanted?
     <br>
     d. Learning: Did the team stretch themselves? Did they try to learn something new? Did the team actually understand the problem statement well?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    1. The above mentioned criteria will guide judges but ultimately judges are free to make decisions based on their gut feeling of which projects are the most impressive and most deserving.
    <br>
    2. The judging process is asynchronous, and these parts of your submission are what judges will use to evaluate your project.
    <br>
    3. Any participant found to be indulging in any form of malpractice will be immediately disqualified.
    <br>
    4. The decision of the review committee and the organizers in declaring the results will be final. No queries in this regard will be entertained.
    <br>
    5. If a project code is found to be plagiarized, it will lead to immediate disqualification of the team from the competition.

  <h1>Detailed Statement</h1>
  <p>
    Participants have to come up with unique ideas and use appropriate technology to build a 'Sign Language Translator'. The translator should be able to enhance the accessibility and efficiency of communication for people with speech and hearing disabilities.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h1>History/Background</h1>
  <p>
    Ever Wondered how the world would be a different place if everybody could communicate effectively? Communication is not just a medium to exchange ideas but also a very important tool for education.
    <br>
    Not everybody communicates the same way, As per WHO about 63 million people in India are deaf and about 7.45% of the total disabled population in India suffers from speech impairment. So the proportion of the population which uses sign language is also considerable. The main concern of using Sign Language is that it can not be understood by everyone, which hampers effectiveness while communicating.

  <h1>Detailed Statement</h1>
  <p>
    Participants have to use AI ML to tackle the problem of farmer illiteracy and unawareness, to improve efficiency in the agriculture sector, which can aid farmers in getting to know about schemes, policies, incentives by the government, as well as using cropping techniques, best seed quality etc, for their land/soil condition.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h1>History/Background</h1>
  <p>
    Farmers are rightly called the backbone of India and have a major contribution in the economy of our country. Agriculture contributes about 18 per cent to the total GDP and provides employment to over 60 per cent of the population.
    <br>
    But in recent times we have seen proliferation in the suicide rates of farmers. Every year, more than 12000 farmers (data since the year 2013) commit suicide in India. Farmers’ suicides seem to be commonplace in India. 10% of all suicides in India are commited by farmers. Various reasons such as monsoon failure, climate change, high-debt burdens, Government policies, mental health, climate changes, interstate water disputes, water crisis, lack of awareness, lack of direct integration with market, distressed due to loans, Costs of Agricultural equipment, cost of chemicals and seeds, personal issues and family problems are among the reasons for farmers’ suicides in India .

  <h1>Detailed Statement</h1>
  <p>
    Participants have to develop a deep prediction model, which can take the various quality parameters such as air quality index, toxic gas emissions etc, of a particular place to predict the possibility of developing lung cancer in that area.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h1>History/Background</h1>
  <p>
    Lung cancer is the one of the world's deadliest cancers . It is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      It kills 1.76 million people every year. In India, with a mortality rate 5/100,000, it is responsible for 63,475 deaths annually.1 It is responsible for 7.5% of cancer Disability-Adjusted Life-Years (DALY) in the country. It's very difficult to detect, and even chemotherapy sometimes doesn't work. Only 16% of lung cancers are identified at an early stage, making treatment and survival much more difficult.

  <h1>Detailed Statement</h1>
  <p>
    Create a regression model based on easily available data, such as the worldwide UV erythemal irradiance recorded at ground surface stations or extrapolated from satellite information, that properly forecast ER and UV doses, and can predict the amount of UV exposure in a particular region.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h1>History/Background</h1>
  <p>
    There are three classification of uv rays: UVA , UVB , UVC. UVA and UVB reaches the earth surface and penetrates deep into the skin of living organisms which causes sunburn as a short term effect while over exposure to that causes premature ageing , skin cancer.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    UV exposure increases the risk of potentially blinding eye diseases. The graph of skin cancer  increased rapidly in the past few years because of the depletion of the ozone layer and hence more contact with UV radiation. Each year, more new cases of skin cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. than new cases of breast, prostate, lung, and colon cancer combined. One in five Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime. One American dies from skin cancer every hour. Unprotected exposure to UV radiation is the most preventable risk factor for skin cancer.

  <h1>Detailed Statement</h1>
  <p>
    To improve workers safety and increase productivity, participants have to develop, using AI ML, suitable devices/technologies to alert and prepare workers, working in extreme environments such as mining sites, against hazardous conditions.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h1>History/Background</h1>
  <p>
    One of the most dangerous industries in the world is the mining industry. Daily life threatening dangers for workers are present both above and below the ground.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Mining activities not only damage the existing environment but also have a negative impact on human health. In one year, more than 15,000 miners are either killed or injured in the mining industry globally. PM or Particulate Matter is a primary pollutant that is produced from surface mining. Studies have indicated that airborne PM can have adverse effects on human life by increased cardiovascular disease, cancer, reduced lung capacity, pneumoconiosis, etc.Miners or people living around places where radioactive gases such as Radon are emitted can suffer from long-term respiratory complications like lung cancer. Exposure to welding fumes can cause poisoning and lung irritation. The radioactive minerals are always going to affect the people living around the mining sites.

  <h1>Detailed Statement</h1>
  <p>
    Participants have to design an automated judging model which can manage the databases of all the cases, to increase efficiency and reduce backlogs of the judicial system in India.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h1>History/Background</h1>
  <p>
    The essential structure that forms the basis of the Indian constitution is the judiciary. The legislative, the executive branch and the judiciary. These are the three basic pillars of the Indian constitution. As it is an autonomous body, the Indian judiciary is recognised as one of the most significant foundations. Despite its overwhelming power, the Indian judiciary faces many fundamental challenges. For example the Indian court system is inconsistent, understaffed, and most importantly incredibly slow.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The major issues that the Indian judicial system faces are:
      <br>
      1. The pendency of cases
      <br>
      2. Corruption
      <br>
      3. Lack of transparency (particularly in the appointment of judges)
      <br>
      4. Judicial vacancies
      <br>
      5. Under trials of the accused
      <br>
      6. Lack of information and interaction among people and courts
